# UC-Module-11
### Project Overview

* This project focuses on building a regression model to **predict the price** of used cars leveraging the given dataset.
* The primary business objective is to identify the **key drivers (attributes)** that have the **largest positive and negative impact on pricing**.

### Data Overview

* The dataset contains **426k entries and 18 columns**.
* **Year (Age), Odometer, and car condition** have been the three main drivers throughout my analysis.
* The attributes have been **log-transformed and filtered** as deemed appropriate to eliminate the null values and address data skewness.

### Regression Modeling

**Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression** have been performed and the Ridge model has been selected as the best fit, as it exhibited the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) value among the models. Significant detail has been added in the notes and accompanying documentation to explain my thought process and model selection rationale.

### Summary

Summary has been provided towards the end of the file in a way that can be presented to a car dealership client. I explained my analysis and approach in detail, and also on a high level for the client. The biases and challenges have been clearly stated and recommendations have been provided in the file.

### Please note the following:

* I incorporated feedback from last time and tried to make my Readme more presentable.
* I also performed IQR on the dataset and tried to be more detailed in my approach.
* All my notes now have a header followed by a colon (:) to distinguish between the assignment requirements and my notes.
